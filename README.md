## 1. The game of pig

The game of Pig is a simple two-player dice game in which you compete with computer to reach 100 points to wins. Players take turns. On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die:

- If the player rolls a 1, then the player gets no new points and it becomes the other player’s turn.

- If the player rolls 2 through 6, then he or she can either:

  ROLL AGAIN or
  
  HOLD. (The sum of all rolls is added to the player’s score, and it becomes the other player’s turn.)
