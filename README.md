## 1. The game of pig

The game of Pig is a simple two-player dice game in which you compete with computer to reach 100 points to wins. Players take turns. On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die:

- If the player rolls a 1, then the player gets no new points and it becomes the other player’s turn.

- If the player rolls 2 through 6, then he or she can either:

  ROLL AGAIN or
  
  HOLD. (The sum of all rolls is added to the player’s score, and it becomes the other player’s turn.)

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe
**I think my program is really simple and concise :)**

Write a program that will allow two users to play tic-tac-toe. The program should ask for moves alternately from player X and player O.
The players enter their moves by entering the position number they wish to mark. After each move, the program displays the changed board. A sample board con-figuration is 

X 	X 	O 

4 	5 	6 

O 	8 	9
